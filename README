i3po dictionary tool for i2b2

(Give some cool explanation here)

JD's Lazy I-don't-wanna-install-ide-plugins-for-axis2-deployment Deployment Strategy

	Currently using Axis2 via Tomcat. To deploy, go to axis2 directory of
	/bin and 'jar -cvf DefinitionService.aar ./*' to create the service.
	Move the DefinitionService.aar to your <APACHE_HOME>/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/
	services/ directory. Copy all .class files in /bin to appropriate places in
	directory structure under <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/
	classes/ directory (i.e. 'cp -R ./* $APACHE_HOME/webapps/axis2/
	WEB-INF/classes/'). Restart Tomcat and services should be up. You can test the
	current service by running the java test (TestDefinitionClient.java).
	
	I've included a deploy.sh that accomplishes the above, though it's specific to
	my directory structure. It'll stay that way until someone wants to generalize 
	it by scripting it in python/ruby/perl/brainfuck/java, etc. (java? seriously, 
	who scripts in java?)
	
TODO
	Remember to include MySQL JDBC connector if running on a local machine
